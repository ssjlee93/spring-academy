# Lab: Implementing GET

This lab implements and tests an API.  
seems like an integration testing where contexts are loaded and checking all functionalities from controller.  
Mocked an API call w `restTemplate` and tested its return values.  

## DocumentContext and JsonPath
seems like a tool for parsing JSON easily.  
Jayway project is Jackson, Gson alternative.  
only good for traversing large JSON.  
good for testing I guess.
